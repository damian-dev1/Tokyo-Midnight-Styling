# Tokyo Midnight Styling

Welcome to **Tokyo Midnight Styling** — a curated collection of GUI projects, web interfaces, and scripts all unified under a signature **Tokyo Midnight** aesthetic.

Inspired by the neon glow of Tokyo nights, this repository showcases dark-themed, high-contrast UI designs with a modern edge — blending deep indigo, neon cyan, and subtle animations for an elegant, immersive developer experience.

## Theme Philosophy

The Tokyo Midnight theme is crafted for:

- Developers who prefer dark mode environments
- Stylish and clean visuals that reduce eye strain
- Consistent and reusable themes across projects

## Repository Structure

This repository will evolve into a suite of projects styled with Tokyo Midnight, including:

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `tk_midnight_tree` | A midnight-themed file explorer built with `tkinter` | Python, Tkinter, ttkbootstrap |
| `video_enhancer_gui` | GPU-accelerated video enhancer with Tokyo Midnight skin | Python, FFmpeg, Tkinter, NVENC |
| `dark_flask_dashboard` | Flask dashboard with dark Tokyo UI | Flask, Bootstrap 5, Tokyo Midnight CSS |
| More coming soon... | CLI tools, web templates, and GUI apps | Python, VBA, Electron, React |

## Visual Design

Core styling elements include:

- Background: `#0A0F1F` (deep indigo)
- Accent: `#00FFFF` (neon cyan)
- Typography: Sans-serif fonts, white-on-dark contrast
- Highlights: Hover effects and animated active elements

Theme assets, reusable CSS, and color palettes will be located in `/themes`.

## Getting Started

Each project contains a separate README with setup and usage instructions.
